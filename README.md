## Why KeepClean?

Every time you wipe down your MacBook, stray keypresses open apps, move windows, and type gibberish. KeepClean solves this in one click — disable the built-in keyboard (and optionally the trackpad), clean your Mac, then re-enable everything instantly.

- **No accounts, no analytics, no internet required.** Runs entirely offline.
- **Lightweight and native.** Built with Swift and SwiftUI.
- **Safe by design.** Keyboard-only mode keeps the trackpad active, and timed mode always auto-recovers.

## Quick Start

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/adhamhaithameid/keep-clean/releases) (`.dmg` or `.zip`).
2. Move `KeepClean.app` to your Applications folder.
3. Open it — the one-time setup screen guides you through granting two permissions:
   - **Accessibility** — lets the app intercept keyboard events.
   - **Input Monitoring** — lets the app actually block them.
4. Click **Disable Keyboard** and start cleaning.

> [!TIP]
> If macOS warns about an unsigned app: right-click `KeepClean.app` → **Open** → click **Open** in the dialog.

## Features

### 🧹 Disable Keyboard

Turns off only the built-in keyboard. The trackpad stays fully active, so you can click **Re-enable Keyboard** at any time. This is the safest mode and the recommended starting point.

### 🧼 Disable Keyboard + Trackpad

Turns off both for a configurable timer (15–180 seconds). Everything is restored automatically when the countdown finishes. Perfect for a thorough screen and keyboard wipe.

### ⚙️ Settings

- Choose your preferred timer duration.
- Toggle **auto-start** to begin keyboard-only cleaning the moment you open the app.

## Permissions

KeepClean needs two macOS permissions to work. Both are requested through a guided setup screen that appears the first time you open the app:

| Permission | Why | What happens without it |
|---|---|---|
| **Accessibility** | Create event taps to intercept keyboard events | The app can't disable the keyboard at all |
| **Input Monitoring** | Actually block events from reaching other apps | Events are intercepted but not blocked — keys still type |

If either permission is revoked later, the app automatically returns to the setup screen. You can also re-grant permissions from the banners shown in the main interface.

## Safety

KeepClean is deliberately conservative:

- **Keyboard-only mode** keeps the trackpad active — you always have a way to interact.
- **Timed mode** always has a deadline and auto-recovers.
- **Closing the window quits the app** — it never lingers in the background.
- **Only built-in devices** are affected — external keyboards and mice are never touched.
